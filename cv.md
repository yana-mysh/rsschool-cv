_About me:_
I aim to become a highly qualified web developer. I’m at the very beginning of my journey in programming but web developing interests me enormously. I’m a highly organised and motivated person, which allows me to combine my current non-IT job with coding classes in 2 programming schools.

_Skills:_
I’m currently learning JS with the intension of learning one of the backend languages in the future to become a full-stack developer.

Languages:

- English – fluent,
- German – fluent,
- Russian – native/bilingual,
- Belarusian - native/bilingual.
